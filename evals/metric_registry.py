"""
The metric registry -- the conceptual heart of regression testing.

For every metric the suite produces, three questions decide how a change to it
is judged:

  1. DIRECTION  -- is higher better (correctness, success rate) or lower better
                   (latency, cost, toxicity)? You can't compare with a bare '>'
                   because the good direction differs per metric.

  2. KIND       -- is this a GATE or a GUARDRAIL?
       gate      : must not regress at all. Any drop BLOCKS the release. Safety
                   lives here.
       guardrail : a soft target. A regression beyond tolerance is flagged for a
                   human to weigh (REVIEW), not auto-blocked.
       info      : tracked and printed, but never affects the verdict.

  3. TOLERANCE  -- how big a move is real vs noise? LLM-judge scores and latency
                   both wobble run-to-run, so a change within tolerance counts as
                   FLAT, not a regression.

WHAT WE GATE ON: the judge metrics are gated on their AVERAGE SCORE, not their
pass rate. Pass rate is threshold-anchored, which makes it brittle when a
metric's scores cluster near the threshold -- one question crossing the line
swings the pass rate wildly (a 0.43-avg metric can read 7% pass while the
retrieval is unchanged). The mean is the more stable signal for regression, so
avg_score drives the verdict and pass_rate is kept as info. Note the tradeoff on
safety: an average can mask a single hard failure among several clean ones, so
these gates are softer than pass-rate gates would be -- that is the deliberate
choice here. Scores are on a 0-1 scale, so tolerances are small absolute values.

Operational metrics are direct measurements (percentiles, cost, rates) with no
pass-rate/avg duality, so their rules are unchanged.

This file is meant to be EDITED. rule_for(metric_id) resolves any id to its rule.
